# Testing Techniques

There are several existing testing techniques, so we will address the techniques mentioned in the syllabus where testing techniques are classified as black-box, white-box, and experience-based.

**Black-Box Testing Techniques** (also known as specification-based techniques) are based on an analysis of the specific behavior of the test object without reference to its internal structure. Therefore, test cases are independent of how the software is implemented. Consequently, if the implementation changes but the required behavior remains the same, the test cases will still be useful. The most common black-box techniques are Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, and State Transition Testing.

**White-Box Testing Techniques** (also known as structure-based techniques) rely on an analysis of the internal structure and processing of the test object. Since test cases depend on how the software is designed, they can only be created after the design or implementation of the test object. The most common techniques are Statement Testing and Branch Testing.

**Experience-Based Testing Techniques** effectively use the knowledge and experience of Testers for the design and implementation of test cases. The effectiveness of these techniques depends heavily on the Testerâ€™s skills. Experience-based testing techniques can detect defects that may not be identified using black-box and white-box testing techniques. Therefore, experience-based testing techniques are complementary to black-box and white-box testing techniques. The most common techniques are Error Guessing, Exploratory Testing, and Checklist-Based Testing.
