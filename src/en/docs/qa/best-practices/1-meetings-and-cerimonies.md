# Meetings and Ceremonies

The teamâ€™s meetings and ceremonies depend on the agile methodology adopted, with Scrum and Kanban being the most common ones. It's common for a team to use one of these in their daily work but hold meetings from the other. For example, teams using Kanban might hold a retrospective, which is typically part of Scrum.

It is important that the QA **participates in all meetings and ceremonies** that involve the product, from refinement to retrospectives, and actively contributes to these meetings, encouraging the team to focus on quality.

For example, during refinements, the QA highlights possible issues that may occur, attention points during development, and tests that developers can perform before concluding the task. In estimation and planning meetings, the QA can present potential blockers that require more testing time or tasks where development time is short but testing time is long, ensuring these tasks are prioritized at the start of the sprint. In daily stand-ups, it is **important to mention what was done yesterday, what is being worked on today, and whether there are any blockers.** In review meetings, it is essential to verify if the delivery meets the requirements and acceptance criteria. Finally, during retrospectives, the QA can bring up any obstacles faced during the cycle and errors encountered.
