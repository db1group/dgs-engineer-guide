# Creation/Writing of Test Cases:

The creation and writing of test cases are essential to ensure the quality of the software being developed. A well-written test case should be clear, concise, and cover all functional and non-functional aspects of the system in question. Below are the guidelines for writing test cases:

## Understanding the Requirement:

- Before writing a test case, it is essential to fully understand the clientâ€™s requirements. Review the specifications, designs, and any other related documentation.

## Identifying Test Scenarios:

- Break down the requirements into distinct test scenarios. A test scenario should represent a specific functionality or a part of the system that needs to be validated.

## Writing the Test Case:

- **Title:** Provide a clear and descriptive name for the test case.

- **Objective:** Briefly describe what the test intends to validate.

- **Pre-conditions:** List the conditions that must be met before the test can be executed.

- **Steps for execution:** Detail each step that must be followed to execute the test. Each step should be clear and executable.

- **Input data:** Include any data needed for the execution of the test.

- **Expected result:** Describe the expected result for each step and eventually for the test case as a whole.

- **Post-conditions:** If necessary, describe the expected state of the system after the test execution.

- **Coverage and Granularity (Level of Detail):** Ensure that the test cases cover all main functionalities and flows, including alternative and error scenarios. The level of detail should allow anyone on the team to execute the test without difficulties.

- **Review and Maintenance:** Regularly review test cases to ensure they are up to date as the system evolves. This includes adapting to new requirements or changes in system behavior.

- **Test Management Tools:** Use a test management tool to organize, version, and maintain test cases. This facilitates the tracking and execution of tests and provides a clear view of the progress of the validations. Check the documentation of useful Tools for QA.
