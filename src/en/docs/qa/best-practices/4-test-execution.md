# Test Execution

Test execution consists of running the planned test and comparing the expected result with the actual result obtained by executing the software. At this stage, the QA follows the plan and performs the test step by step. It is important to check all the details listed below.

## Test Planning:

Verify if the Test Planning has been completed and is up-to-date. Execute what was planned, gather test evidence, and verify the results.

## Software Version:

Check which software version contains the implementation of the new request and install it. Avoid performing version downgrades; always uninstall the current version and install the new one.

## Test Environment:

Check in which environment the implementation is available for testing.

## Test Data:

Verify that the test data being used is correct.

## Layout Standards:

Check the layout standards of the software being tested, and ensure that these standards are respected in new implementations.

## Information or Error Messages:

Check spelling, ensure the message makes sense, and verify it is understandable for the user.

## Screen Transitions:

Verify if the layout is correctly maintained when transitioning between screens.

## Forward and Backward Navigation between Screens:

Ensure the software works correctly when moving forward or backward between screens. For example, in mobile testing, perform navigation both via the app and using the native back button.

## Resizing:

Verify how the software behaves on different screen sizes.

## Devices:

Check which devices or platforms the software should work on, and whenever possible, test on all of them.

## Security:

Ensure that the software does not display sensitive data on unsecured screens.
