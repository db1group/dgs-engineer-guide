# Pipeline Execution

This document describes the process of executing CI/CD pipelines.

## Objective

Ensure that all changes are integrated and delivered continuously, maintaining quality and efficiency.

## Steps

1. **Configure the Pipeline**:
    - Define the stages of the pipeline (build, test, deploy).
    - Configure CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI, Travis CI, Azure Pipelines, GoCD, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions).

2. **Validate the Configuration**:
    - Verify that all dependencies are correctly configured.
    - Perform initial tests to ensure the pipeline is functioning.

3. **Execute the Pipeline**:
    - Start the pipeline execution.
    - Monitor the execution in real-time.

4. **Monitor the Execution**:
    - Check logs and metrics during execution.
    - Identify and resolve any issues that arise.
