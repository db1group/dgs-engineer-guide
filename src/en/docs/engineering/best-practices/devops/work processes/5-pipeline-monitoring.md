    - Set up alerts for pipeline failures.
    - Configure notifications for the team via email, Slack, etc.

2. **Monitor Logs and Metrics**:
    - Use monitoring tools to track logs and metrics.
    - Analyze logs to identify the root cause of failures.

3. **Analyze Failures and Take Corrective Actions**:
    - Investigate failures and identify the root cause.
    - Implement fixes and re-run the pipeline.

## Tools Used

- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting system.
- **Grafana**: Metrics analysis and visualization platform.
- **ELK Stack**: Set of tools for log search, analysis, and visualization (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
